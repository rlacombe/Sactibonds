# Sactibonds
Evaluating protein structure prediction models by how closely they match known sulfur-to-alpha-carbon post-translational modifications.


### Usage

To compute the predicted structures for the peptides, run:
```bash
python peptide_folding.py
```

To evaluate the predicted structures, run:

```bash
python structure_eval.py
```

### Sources

Sactibond structures for the following peptides were taken from:

- Subtilosin A
- Thuringin H
- Thuringin CD alpha
- Thuringin CD beta
